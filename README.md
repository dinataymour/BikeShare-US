# BikeShare-US
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. In addition, I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
